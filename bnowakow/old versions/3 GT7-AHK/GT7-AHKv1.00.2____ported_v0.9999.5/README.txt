The setup folder contains all the settings you need to make sure the script works.

Run the GT7AHK .exe or .ahk file to run the script.

Make sure you hover the "Retry" button when you start it.

All mods can be selected one by one.
The PanAm includes:
    Championship Menus --> MUST BE ENABLED
    Check Turns --> MUST BE ENABLED    
    Maintenance --> this isn't a must, but if you're running the script for longer than 3 hours nonstop, it's recommended.

The other mods are for the upcoming Tokyo script, so they don't matter, can be disabled.
